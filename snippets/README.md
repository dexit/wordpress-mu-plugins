# Snippets

**Usage**: Can be used in functions.php file or as part of snippets plugin such as https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/ .

Each snippet is usually understood by going through the code. Even if you don't understand, there is usually a reference article that explains a bit about the code. Please create an issue in Github, if you don't understand anything, if you have seen any bugs or if you'd like to improve any code.

Happy Coding!
